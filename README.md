# SpeedScore Application for Exploration 8.4

This repository contains the code for the SpeedScore personal speedfgolf app. It is a special version of the app developed in the book *Full Stack Web Development from the Ground Up* (first edition) by Chris Hundhausen, published by Morgan Kaufmann

This version of SpeedScore supports the following functionality:
* creating acounts
* logging in with an account
* viewing/editing account profile
* switching between app modes
* viewing/editing/logging golf rounds

We will develop principled test suites for some of this functionality in Exploration 8.4. In Team Lab 8, your team will expand on this effort.
